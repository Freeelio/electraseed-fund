### System Modeling Techniques
ElectraSeed Fund is a pool of revenue shares and impact measures of a globally diversified portoflio of smart microgrids.
The goal is to increase positive impact and reduce risk within the pool.

For this we employ both:
* __financial engineering__ via [pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooling_(resource_management)#Finance), resulting in diversification of value flows on both sides, the projects and the [funders](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pooledfunds.asp)
* __token engineering__ via 
  * [token curation](https://medium.com/@tokencuratedregistry/the-token-curated-registry-whitepaper-bd2fb29299d6) to identify and stake for projects that will increase positive impact and reduce overall risk
  * [token bonding](https://discourse.sourcecred.io/t/bonding-curve-references/271), which allows bond-to-mint of data, cash, code contributions
  * potentially use the minted token as discount token to incentivize project operators as well as their users
  
_Whilst financial engineering concerns itself primarily with risk, token engineering is about designing and testing transparent incentive mechanisms, which create information symmetry under uncertainty._
  
Since stakeholders of Electraseed Fund are new to tokenized funding, we've found a [game-based](https://github.com/freddbomba/legrandjeu/blob/master/doc/legrandjeu.md) model & simulation to be very helpful
(see ![Electraseed Fun!](LeGrandJeu-model))

In addition we use [cadCAD](https://github.com/BlockScience/cadCAD), scientific computing framework in Phython for 
financial and token modelling & simulation of Electraseed Fund (see ![Computer Aided Design](cadCAD-models))
