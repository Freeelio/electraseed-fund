    ">* Agents behavior functions P(⋅)can be encoded with Heuristic strategies derived from game theoretic, psychological decision sciences and/or behavioral economics literature.\n",
    ">* Agents behavior functions P(⋅) can be machine learned from past data where the feature space is some characterization of the agent and system states, and the labels are the actions u taken.\n",
    ">* Agents can also have inherently adaptive strategies by encoding them as reinforcement learning agents who will learn to do whatever they can to achieve their goals within the bounds of the action space U. In this case, P(⋅) is itself time varying. \n",

This system includes energy user, asset operator, and the energy asset, with external drivers being geolocation related processes. The energy asset itself can be modelled as a subsystem, which we exclude initially in this v2.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. financial agent model__, in which fair and sufficient capitalization of these projects affects value creation, i.e. revenues and positive impact, and that in turn determines fair capitalization, in a system that involves value aligned funders who care for the positive impact that their capital infusion creates. This system includes funders, with different intentions, project operators, and curators of impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact is assessed according to [indicators defined in UN Sustainable Development Goal of \"Affordable and Clean Energy\" (SDG 7)](https://sdg-tracker.org/energy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, since we create a __coupled tokenized system__ through an augmented [token bonding curve](https://discourse.sourcecred.io/t/bonding-curve-references/271), additional incentive schemes that will be implemented and A/B tested will have an effect on optimal use and operation as well as funding, i.e. agent bahavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. tokenized system model__ consists of Funding Pool, Liquidity Reserve, and Impact Record. Impact Record logs the derived impact indicators from energy usage data. Liquidity Reserve is increased by the revenue shares from project operators and/or their sponsors, e.g. municipalities, diaspora etc. or [sponsored burn](https://medium.com/@avsa/sponsored-burning-for-tcr-c0ab08eef9d4) by sponsors of SDG 7, e.g. international aid agencies, family offices, etc. When funders bond cash to mint tokens of Electraseed Fund, a portion of the funds go to Reserve and the other portion goes into the Funding Pool. \n",

In this version v2 \"Benoit\" we assume simple fund release coupled to revenue share and data logged into Impact Record. Hence, the curators are not yet modelled in this subsystem. The staking mechanism in the Funding Pool can be interpreted as a staging insurance. This system will be included in v3 \"Carmen\"_\n",
