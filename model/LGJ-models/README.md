This folder contains iterations of "Electraseed Fun!", [forked from "Le Grand Jeu"](https://github.com/Freeelio/legrandjeu) - A game to let stakeholders experience complex systems of 
- impact investment, 
- social, economic, environmental impact of clean energy access especially in rural regions of the developing world,
- decentralized finance, tokenized crowdfunding models, 
- incentive mechanisms that can be modelled when the scheme is tokenized etc. 

We kicked off our first iteration in  Den Haag, at the [Odyssey Connect](https://connect.odyssey.org/) event. For those who are not familiar with Odyssey: It's the biggest hackathon in interdisciplinary blockchain space ([2019 impressions](https://youtu.be/TrRJJbmT9e0)). We are part of the [2020 "Fossil Free Future" Track](https://www.odyssey.org/track-fossil-free-future-2020/), and are also working on adapting Le Grand Jeu for our track members and Odyssey at large (contribute [here]()). Odyssey has an innovation ecosystem that is pioneer in [tokenization and crossing the chasm](https://youtu.be/ix5K4v-BgYo).

The first iteration focussed on explaining the new tokenized funding mechanims, and hence is titled
"Electraseed Fun! with Augmented Bonding Curves". Look [what people say](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6631204731429634048/), and have a look around in this repo.
